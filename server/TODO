plan/things to do:
- each iteration of the main:while(true) main gameplay loop should be one players turn.
- (after potentially dealing) We need to start an interrupt timer. then, we run another infinite? loop recieving messages about what moves the current player makes.
We need to exit this inner move-loop when either 1. the player busts, 2. the player stands, or 3. the timer expires.
